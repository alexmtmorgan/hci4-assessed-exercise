# Report (overall this is worth 15%)

See [here](http://moodle2.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/658002/mod_resource/content/0/HCI4%20assessed%20exercise%202015.pdf) for the specification document.

## Design (30%)

>Start the process by coming up with an idea and then building paper prototypes of it. You can quickly evaluate these prototypes using things like Heuristic evaluation and Think Aloud. Try and test with people who are in your target user group, rather than just classmates. I will put up the notes from last year on Moodle so that you can get a reminder of some of the techniques you might use.    
If your prototype doesn’t work then start again, that is the beauty of paper! Keep these versions though so you can include them in your report. It is good to see the process of design you went through.    
When you have a good paper design you can start to implement it.

We want the thing to do the things

## Implementation (20%)

>Use any language/OS/platform you like, although it might be a good idea to use something you are familiar with due to the short time available. We can provide some phones, vibration motors, etc. Please ask to see if we have something that you might need. Don’t spend all of your time implementing; this won’t get you the best marks. You need to show your design and evaluation too. 

We made the thing do the things.

## Evaluation (25%)

>We want you to evaluate the prototype you implemented to show that it works, and refine it if necessary to make it even better. Evaluation should occur with real end users if you can manage it. These evaluations should be more controlled than those you used for the design part, perhaps using the experimental evaluation techniques we talked about in the lectures. We want you to use a broad range of evaluation techniques and show them in your report, so don’t just use the same techniques as in the earlier part.

We got people to say how well the thing does things.

## Demo (10%)

>You will demo your prototype to one of the lecturers in the lecture slots in the last week of term. You will have a fixed 5 minute slot to show off the system you have developed and what it can do.

This will be done on Tuesday 2nd December.
